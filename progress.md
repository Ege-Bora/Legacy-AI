## 🌟 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

**Life Legacy AI** is an innovative mobile application that transforms the way people capture, organize, and preserve their most meaningful memories and life stories. By combining cutting-edge voice recognition technology with artificial intelligence, we're creating a living repository of human experiences that can be treasured by current and future generations.

### **What Life Legacy AI Does**

At its core, Life Legacy AI serves as an intelligent memory companion that makes capturing life stories as simple as having a conversation. Users speak naturally into their device, and our advanced AI transforms these voice recordings into beautifully organized, searchable memories that can evolve into comprehensive life narratives.

### **Core Features & Technology**

**🎤 Intelligent Voice Capture**
- High-quality audio recording with automatic transcription via OpenAI's Whisper API
- Natural language processing that understands context, emotions, and key details
- Support for multiple languages and dialects

**📚 Smart Memory Organization**
- Automatic categorization of memories into thematic books and chapters
- Default "Quick Memo Book" for spontaneous thoughts and daily reflections
- User-controlled organization with the flexibility to create custom memory collections
- AI-powered tagging and cross-referencing of related memories

**🤖 AI Interview Mode**
- Interactive AI companion that asks thoughtful, personalized questions
- Guided storytelling sessions that help users explore and articulate important life experiences
- Adaptive questioning that builds on previous responses to create rich, detailed narratives
- Professional interviewing techniques embedded in conversational AI

**📖 Living Memory Books**
- Memories automatically structured into coherent chapters and themes
- AI-enhanced narrative flow that connects related experiences across time
- Rich multimedia integration supporting photos, documents, and voice recordings
- Export capabilities for PDF, EPUB, and other formats for sharing and preservation

### **The Impact We're Creating**

Life Legacy AI addresses a fundamental human need: the desire to be remembered and to pass on wisdom, experiences, and stories to those we love. In an age where digital communication is fragmenting our ability to preserve deep, meaningful narratives, we're providing a solution that makes legacy creation accessible, engaging, and sustainable.

**For Individuals**: Transform scattered memories into coherent life stories, discover patterns and meaning in personal experiences, and create lasting legacies for family and friends.

**For Families**: Bridge generational gaps by preserving the voices, stories, and wisdom of older family members while making them accessible to younger generations.

**For Society**: Contribute to a richer understanding of human experience by preserving diverse voices and stories that might otherwise be lost to time.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. Authentication System (HIGH PRIORITY) 
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: JWT-based authentication with email/password
- **Features**: Registration, login, token refresh, protected routes
- **Database**: In-memory storage (development) - ready for production DB upgrade
- **API Endpoints**: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`
- **Testing**: ✅ All endpoints working correctly
- **Components**: AuthService, middleware, routes, in-memory database fallback
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, JWT tokens with refresh mechanism

### 2. Quick Memo Logic Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: 🔴 Architectural issue
- **Problem**: Every memo risks becoming separate file/book
- **Requirement**: All quick memos should **default into single "Quick Memo Book"**
- **Solution**: User can explicitly create other books, but default behavior consolidated

### 3. Monetization System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Status**: 🔴 Not started
- **Required**: Payment/subscription/monetization logic
- **Dependencies**: Stripe or similar payment processor integration

### 4. Audio Pipeline Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Status**: 🟡 Partially implemented
- **Need to Test**: Full pipeline - record audio → Whisper transcription → memory creation → AI interview
- **Current**: Backend endpoints exist, need end-to-end validation

### 5. UI Polish (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Status**: 🟡 Groundwork done
- **Details**: Small corrections needed, foundation established
- **Type**: Visual/UX improvements

### 6. Performance Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Status**: 🟡 Investigation needed
- **Issue**: Claude's terminal agent uses high CPU on Mac
- **Action**: Need to investigate impact and possible optimizations

## 🚨 Next Steps to Fix Issues

### **1. Restart Redis Container**
```bash
docker start legacy-redis
# Verify: docker ps | grep legacy-redis
```

### **2. Start Worker Process**
```bash
cd ~/legacy/Legacy\ AI
pnpm -C backend/apps/worker dev
# Or: pnpm dev:worker
```

### **3. Clean Up Stale API Processes (Optional)**
```bash
# Kill stale processes to free resources
kill 3984 74880
# Current process (4339) will continue running
```

### **4. Verify Full Stack Health**
```bash
# Check all services are running
curl http://localhost:8080/health
docker ps | grep legacy-redis
ps aux | grep "tsx watch" | grep -v grep
```

**Priority**: Fix Redis (HIGH) → Start Worker (HIGH) → Clean stale processes (LOW)
